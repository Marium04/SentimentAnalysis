# SentimentAnalysis

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.28.3. This project is only a proof of concept. The idea of the project is to pull public data from facebook's public brand page to do the sentiment analysis on the public comments posted by users, using an open source npm library called "salient" and then to finally show the results in a bar chart using d3 & highcharts.

## Development server
Run `npm start` and navigate to http://localhost:8080/ .


## Further help

To get more help on the `angular-cli` use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular-CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).

## Project update
This won't work right now since facebook has restricted access to even the public facebook page's data.
